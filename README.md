### Description: 
FoodWeb is a web app implementation to reduce wastage of food left unused.

### Problem statement: 
Wastage of food is one of the biggest issues. Almost one third of the foods produced in the world goes to waste. From restaurant and lawn left overs, to grocers disposing off imperfect produce, to spoiled food, roughly $400B of food end up to be dumped every year resulting in 3.3 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. (ref: http://foodtechconnect.com/2015/10/09/10-startups-reducing-food-waste-one-byte-at-a-time/)

At the same time, worldwide nearly 800 million people do not have enough to eat. That means one in nine people are suffering from hunger. Hunger and malnutrition are the number one risk to health worldwide. (ref: https://www.foodbanking.org/hunger-food-banking/about-hunger/global-hunger)

So we thought about merging this gap by providing a platform to collect the leftovers and then providing the same to those in need.

### Instructions:
* Users can register as a donor(Restaurants/caf√©s/lawns) or as a NGO.
* Donors will raise a request, in case of any leftover food they have.
* They will be able to donate using location, type of food, quantity of food, contact num.
* Donors will get notified about their request being accepted and can view details.
* NGO will be notified about requsest to pick food at various donor sites.
* They can accept, view and reject a request.
* NGOs will reach for the pickup and will supply to the hunger spots.
